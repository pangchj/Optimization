# Optimization codes

Here are some optimization codes that may be helpful when you want to learn or implement an optimization algorithm. I take the code description from certain textbooks and write python codes so that the calculations can be done step by step, and the numerical results can be checked with what the textbook says you should get.

I have implemented:
- Cutting Stock problem
- Dantzig Wolfe decomposition
- Benders decomposition
