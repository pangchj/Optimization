# Optimization codes

Here are some optimization codes that I wrote that may be helpful when you want to learn or implement an optimization algorithm. I take the code description from textbooks and write python codes so that the calculations are done step by step to match the  numerical results given there.

I have implemented:
- Cutting Stock problem (based on example in Chvatal's "Linear Programming")
- Dantzig Wolfe decomposition (based on example in Chvatal's "Linear Programming")
- Benders decomposition (based on example in Lasdon's "Optimization Theory for Large Systems")

If you are looking for free serious linear optimization software that you can use in Python, you can look at Google OR-Tools, PULP or CLP (more features in command line version) to start:
https://developers.google.com/optimization
https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/index.html
https://github.com/coin-or/Clp

I have background in nonlinear programming, but I haven't got interested in writing such codes yet.

Any feedback is appreciated. :)
