# Optimization codes

Here are some optimization codes that I wrote that may be helpful when you want to learn or implement an optimization algorithm. I take the code description from textbooks and write python codes so that the calculations are done step by step to match the  numerical results given there.

I have implemented:
- Cutting Stock problem (based on example in Chvatal's "Linear Programming")
- Dantzig Wolfe decomposition (based on example in Chvatal's "Linear Programming")
- Benders decomposition (based on example in Lasdon's "Optimization Theory for Large Systems")

If you are looking for free serious optimization software in Python, you can try these first:
- CVX: https://cvxopt.org/index.html
- Google OR-Tools: https://developers.google.com/optimization
- PULP: https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/index.html


I have background in nonlinear programming, but I haven't got interested in writing such codes yet.

Any feedback is appreciated. :)
